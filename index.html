    <h2>What are galaxies?</h2>
    <p>
      A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and up to billions of stars, planets, and their own solar systems all held up together by gravity. Our galaxy, The Milky Way is estimated to be around 50,000 light years across. There is an average of 100 thousand million stars in our Milky Way alone all with their own planets and solar systems. This is only from one galaxy, there are millions of billions other galaxies in just the observable universe and there is sure to be more.</p>

    <h2>The Different Types of Galaxies</h2>
    
    <p> With a huge amount of galaxies you must think all look different and you would be right. Galaxies come in all shapes since there formations are randoms. Galaxies are hold together by gravity so anything can happen to their shapes. There are 3 main types of galaxies which are:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4 class="galaxy">Spiral Galaxies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>72% of all galaxies observed by scientist were spiral galaxies</li>
          <li>Shape of a flat rotating disk</li>
          <li>The Milky Way galaxy itself is a spiral galaxy</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4 class = "galaxy">Elliptical Galaxies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>They can be the smallest galaxies but the biggest galaxy ever found was an Elliptical galaxy</li>
          <li>Has the shape of a stretched out circle and are usually flat and smooth</li>
          <li>Contains little dust and gas maing them dim</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4 class = "galaxy">Irregular Galaxies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>They have no particular shape</li>
          <li>Are full of gast and dust which makes them very bright</li>
          <li>Amonng the smallest galaxies</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
